Code_Guru (to chat_manager):

To address the problem of unattached disks and provide a comprehensive analysis of the environment, we will follow these steps:

1. **Analyze the Environment**:
   - List all the resources in the specified resource group.
   - Identify unattached disks.
   - Gather important resource information.

2. **Calculate the Cost**:
   - Retrieve the cost details of the resources in the environment.

3. **Provide Advice**:
   - Based on the analysis, provide recommendations on whether to keep or delete the unattached disks.

### Step 1: Analyze the Environment

#### Using Azure CLI

First, let's list all the resources in the specified resource group and identify unattached disks.

```sh
# Set the subscription
az account set --subscription e9b4640d-1f1f-45fe-a543-c0ea45ac34c1

# List all resources in the resource group
az resource list --resource-group hackathon75 --output table

# List all disks in the resource group
az disk list --resource-group hackathon75 --query "[].{name:name, id:id, managedBy:managedBy}" --output table
```

#### Using Azure PowerShell

```powershell
# Set the subscription
Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId e9b4640d-1f1f-45fe-a543-c0ea45ac34c1

# List all resources in the resource group
Get-AzResource -ResourceGroupName hackathon75 | Format-Table

# List all disks in the resource group
Get-AzDisk -ResourceGroupName hackathon75 | Select-Object Name, Id, ManagedBy | Format-Table
```

### Step 2: Calculate the Cost

#### Using Azure CLI

```sh
# Get cost details for the resource group
az consumption usage list --subscription e9b4640d-1f1f-45fe-a543-c0ea45ac34c1 --query "[?resourceGroup=='hackathon75']" --output table
```

#### Using Azure PowerShell

```powershell
# Get cost details for the resource group
Get-AzConsumptionUsageDetail -ResourceGroupName hackathon75 | Format-Table
```

### Step 3: Provide Advice

Based on the analysis, if the disk is not attached to any VM, it might be an orphaned resource. Here is the advice:

1. **Evaluate the Need for the Disk**:
   - Check if the disk contains any critical data that needs to be retained.
   - Verify if there are any plans to attach the disk to a VM in the near future.

2. **Delete Unnecessary Disks**:
   - If the disk is not needed, delete it to save costs.

#### Using Azure CLI

```sh
# Delete the unattached disk
az disk delete --resource-group hackathon75 --name hackathon75 --yes
```

#### Using Azure PowerShell

```powershell
# Delete the unattached disk
Remove-AzDisk -ResourceGroupName hackathon75 -DiskName hackathon75 -Force
```

### Final Output

#### Summary of the Environment

- **Resource Group**: hackathon75
- **Subscription ID**: e9b4640d-1f1f-45fe-a543-c0ea45ac34c1
- **Resources**: List of all resources in the resource group
- **Unattached Disks**: List of disks not attached to any VM

#### Cost of the Resources

- **Total Cost**: Detailed cost of each resource in the resource group

#### Best Advice

- **Evaluate the Need for the Disk**: Check if the disk contains any critical data or if there are plans to use it.
- **Delete Unnecessary Disks**: If the disk is not needed, delete it to save costs.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage your Azure resources and optimize costs.

Finops_Expert (to chat_manager):

It looks like the command execution was partially successful in listing the resources, but there was an issue with the subsequent steps. I'll provide refined guidance based on the outputs you have and an actionable plan to further examine the environment and costs.

### Refined Analysis and Cost Calculation

Let's break down our approach:

1. **Identify Unattached Disks**:
    - Given that we have already identified that `hackathon75` disk is unattached, we know this disk might be orphaned.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
    - We need specific cost details for the unattached disks and other resources within the resource group to get a clear financial impact.

### Listing Resources and Costs

#### Azure CLI Command:

Re-run and refine the Azure CLI command to gather a detailed resource list and cost breakdown.

1. **List All Resources**:

```sh
az resource list --resource-group hackathon75 --output table
```

2. **List All Disks and Check if Managed by VM**:

```sh
az disk list --resource-group hackathon75 --query "[].{name:name, id:id, managedBy:managedBy}" --output table
```

3. **Retrieve Cost Details**:

```sh
az consumption usage list --subscription e9b4640d-1f1f-45fe-a543-c0ea45ac34c1 --query "[?resourceGroup=='hackathon75']" --output table
```

### Analyze Disk Requirement and Provide Recommendations

We can use the data gathered from the above steps to make a decision about the disk.

**Evaluating Whether the Disk is Needed**:

1. **Check Disk Contents**:
    - Verify if the disk contains any essential data:
    ```sh
    az disk show --resource-group hackathon75 --name hackathon75
    ```
    - Check snapshots or backups associated with this disk if any vital data needs to be preserved.

2. **Deletion**:
    - If deemed unnecessary, proceed to delete the disk to cost save:

    ```sh
    az disk delete --resource-group hackathon75 --name hackathon75 --yes
    ```

#### Final Summary

Based on the data gathered and commands executed, your final summary might look something like this:

### Summary of the Environment

- **Resource Group**: hackathon75
- **Location**: swedencentral
- **Resources**: Computed list of all resources (including VMs, Disks, etc.)
- **Unattached Disks**: `hackathon75` (Not attached to any VM)
- **Subscription ID**: e9b4640d-1f1f-45fe-a543-c0ea45ac34c1

### Cost of the Resources

- **Total Cost**: Compute and list total monthly cost details

### Best Advice:

1. **Evaluate Disk Utilization**:
    - Confirm if `hackathon75` disk contains critical data.
    - Plan to attach the disk if needed shortly.

2. **Delete Disk to Optimize Costs**:
    - If not needed: delete the disk using the command:
    ```sh
    az disk delete --resource-group hackathon75 --name hackathon75 --yes
    ```

This approach should help you properly analyze your Azure environment, compute cost optimizations, and safely manage or remove unnecessary resources.
